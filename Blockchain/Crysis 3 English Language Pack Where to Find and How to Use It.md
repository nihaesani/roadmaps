First, you need to download the English language pack files from one of the links below. The download size is around 500 MB.
 
- [CJS CD Keys](https://www.cjs-cdkeys.com/pages/How-to-change-Crysis-3-Russian-or-Polish-into-English-%252d-language-pack-with-tutorial.html) [^1^]
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B6aRG...) [^2^]
- [MediaFire](http://www.mediafire.com/file/xstnnox...) [^2^]

Next, you need to install the game and activate it with Origin. If you have already done that, you can skip this step. Otherwise, follow these instructions:

1. Purchase or download a Crysis 3 Russian or Polish CD Key from a trusted source.
2. Start the Origin client (downloadable free from [Origin.com](https://www.origin.com/)) and press 'Redeem Code'.
3. Enter your CD Key and press 'Redeem'. The dialog will confirm the activation.
4. Press 'Install' or 'Preload'. Origin will prompt you to select a language. At this point, only Russian or Polish will be available. Don't worry! Just press 'Accept' to start downloading the game.
5. Wait for the game to completely download and install. Once you've totally installed the game, launch the game and then close it again.

Now, you have the game fully installed, but Origin has only downloaded the Russian or Polish language files. To change it to English, you need to copy the English language pack files into your installation directory. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Extract the English language pack files that you downloaded earlier using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
2. You should see two files named english.pak and english\_xml.pak.
3. Copy these two files and paste them into your Crysis 3 installation directory. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Crysis 3\Localization.
4. If prompted to overwrite or replace any existing files, choose 'Yes' or 'Replace'.
5. Launch the game again and enjoy it in English!
