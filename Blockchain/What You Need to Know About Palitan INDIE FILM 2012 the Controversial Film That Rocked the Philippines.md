Palitan is a Filipino independent film that was released in 2012 as part of the Cinema One Originals Digital Film Festival. Directed by Ato Bautista and written by Shugo Praico, the film is a psychological drama-thriller that explores themes of power, lust, betrayal and revenge.
 
The film stars Mon Confiado as Ramiro, a ruthless and manipulative owner of an electronics surplus shop in Raon, Quiapo, Manila. He employs Nestor (Alex Medina), a young and naive man who is deeply in debt to him. Ramiro takes advantage of Nestor's situation and coerces him to spy on his wife Luisa (Mara Lopez), a beautiful and innocent woman who works as a saleslady. Ramiro wants Nestor to record videos of Luisa taking a bath and send them to him in exchange for reducing his debt. Nestor reluctantly agrees, but soon finds himself trapped in a web of lies, jealousy and violence.

If you are looking for a film that will shock you, thrill you and make you think, Palitan is a must-watch. You can watch it online for free at Archive.org[^2^] or buy the DVD at Amazon.com.
  
Palitan is not a film for the faint of heart. It contains scenes of graphic nudity, sex and violence that may shock or offend some viewers. However, the film does not use these elements for mere titillation or exploitation. Rather, it uses them to create a realistic and compelling portrait of human nature and its dark side.
 
The film is also a homage to the classic Filipino film Scorpio Nights (1985), directed by Peque Gallaga. Both films share similar plot elements, such as a voyeuristic landlord, a cuckolded husband and a seductive wife. However, Palitan adds its own twist and updates the story to fit the modern context. The film also pays tribute to other Filipino filmmakers, such as Lino Brocka and Ishmael Bernal, who were known for their social realism and daring themes.
